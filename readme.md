## Coding: Integration Tests with MockMvc

In this task, you will perform integration tests with MockMvc. Use the project from the previous exercises (Product).

* Integrate Flapdoodle into your project.
* Write an integration test for all controller endpoints.

## Bonus: Integration Tests with MockMvc

* Extend your integration test so that it is not necessary to inject the repository.
* Ensure that the product is really removed from the database and is no longer retrievable in the test for the delete endpoint.
